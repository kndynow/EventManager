## Getting Started

**To configure your connection string:**
In the EventManager.Api project:

1. Create a new file named 'appsettings.Development.json' if it doesn't exist.
2. Add your MongoDB connection string to this file using the following format:
   {
     "MongoDbSettings": {
       "ConnectionString": "your_mongodb_connection_string_here",
       "DatabaseName": "EventManager"
     }
   }

4. Ensure this file is not tracked by Git to keep your connection string private.
